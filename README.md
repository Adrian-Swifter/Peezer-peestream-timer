# Peezer.io

Peezer.io is a web application that allows users to measure the duration of their pee streams using the microphone on their device. This unique utility leverages the browser's audio capabilities to record and analyze audio in real-time, calculating the duration of the longest continuous stream. The app is designed with privacy in mind, ensuring that all audio processing is performed locally on the user's device.

## Features

- **Privacy-Focused**: No audio data is ever stored or sent over the network. All analyses are done locally.
- **Add to Home Screen**: Users can add Peezer.io to their home screen on mobile devices for an app-like experience.
- **Local Storage of Data**: Durations and timestamps are saved locally, allowing users to track changes over time.
- **Interactive Graphs**: View historical data through responsive, interactive graphs.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive web design that works on mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

## Getting Started

To use Peezer.io, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [Peezer.io](https://peezer.io) on your mobile browser.
2. Ensure you are in a private setting and your device's microphone is on.
3. Tap the 'Start' button to begin recording the duration of your urine stream.
4. Tap 'Stop' when you are done.
5. View the results, which will include the duration and estimated volume of your urine stream.

## How It Works

Peezer.io uses the microphone on your smartphone to detect the sound of urine hitting the water in the toilet. The app calculates the duration of the stream and estimates the volume based on the duration and the average flow rate, which can be adjusted in the settings based on user characteristics or previous measurements.
