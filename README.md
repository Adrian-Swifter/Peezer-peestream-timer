# Peezer.io

Welcome to Peezer.io, an innovative web app designed to measure the duration and approximate volume of urine streams using your smartphone's microphone. Our app provides a convenient, private way to monitor urinary health and maintain a record that can be useful for medical purposes or personal interest.

## Features

- **Urine Stream Duration**: Measures how long your pee lasts using the sound of urine hitting water.
- **Volume Estimation**: Estimates the volume of your urine stream based on the duration and sound characteristics.
- **Privacy First**: Completely anonymous use, no personal data is stored or required.
- **Health Tracking**: Keep track of urinary trends which might be indicative of health issues.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple interface, start and stop with just one tap.

## Getting Started

To use Peezer.io, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [Peezer.io](https://peezer.io) on your mobile browser.
2. Ensure you are in a private setting and your device's microphone is on.
3. Tap the 'Start' button to begin recording the duration of your urine stream.
4. Tap 'Stop' when you are done.
5. View the results, which will include the duration and estimated volume of your urine stream.

## How It Works

Peezer.io uses the microphone on your smartphone to detect the sound of urine hitting the water in the toilet. The app calculates the duration of the stream and estimates the volume based on the duration and the average flow rate, which can be adjusted in the settings based on user characteristics or previous measurements.
